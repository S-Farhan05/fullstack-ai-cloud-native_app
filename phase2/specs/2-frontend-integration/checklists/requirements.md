# Specification Quality Checklist: Frontend Application & Full-Stack Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Validation Date**: 2026-02-07
**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Ready for planning

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: All user stories, requirements, and success criteria focus on user outcomes and business value without prescribing implementation. Technology references (FastAPI, browsers) appear only in dependencies/assumptions sections where they document existing external systems.

**Completeness**: Specification includes 6 prioritized user stories with comprehensive acceptance scenarios, 22 functional requirements, 10 measurable success criteria, clear scope boundaries, and documented assumptions/dependencies.

**Readiness**: No clarifications needed. Specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan` phase.
