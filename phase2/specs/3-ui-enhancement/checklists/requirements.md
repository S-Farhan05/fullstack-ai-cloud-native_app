# Specification Quality Checklist: Frontend UI Enhancement & Experience

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items complete

**Details**:
- All 16 validation items passed
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are sufficiently specified
- User stories are prioritized and independently testable
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Scope is clearly bounded with explicit out-of-scope items
- Dependencies and constraints are documented

## Notes

- Specification successfully avoids implementation details while providing clear requirements
- All user stories follow the independent testability pattern
- Success criteria focus on user-facing outcomes rather than technical metrics
- Edge cases are identified for planning consideration
- Ready to proceed to `/sp.plan` phase
